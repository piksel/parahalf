# parahalf

### introduction

parahalf is a drop-down terminal/application host, like [tilda](https://github.com/tsloughter/tilda/) or [guake](http://guake.org/) for windows.  
it also supports docking other applications like spotify and notepad.  

note that it is still buggy and there are some quirks to fix. i develop this in my spare time, so excuse the poor code and lack of comments. hopefully i will fix that all of that someday.

### compiling

the project relies on the [newtonsoft json.net library](http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx) and uses [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) for console emulation.
its currently being developed in visual studio 2010 and has not been tested in any other environment.
